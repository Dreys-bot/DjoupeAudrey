title: 3D Generative Adversial Model
description: This article presents an introduction to generative adversarial networks (GANs), a cutting-edge deep learning technique. GANs utilize an adversarial game between two neural networks to generate synthetic data. Applications include image, audio and video synthesis. The goal is to provide a high-level overview of GANs' generative process and vast potential.

# What is GAN model?

![Global GAN Model](/assets/images/globalGANModel.png)
**GAN** is a machine learning model in which two **neural networks** compete with each other by using ***deep learning*** methods to become more accurate in their predictions. GANs typically run unsupervised and use a cooperative ***zero-sum game framework*** to learn, where one person's gain equals another person's loss.
